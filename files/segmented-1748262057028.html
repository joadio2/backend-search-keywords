Eight of them are particularly urgent, mainly to conserve ecosystems, protect people against heat, protect people and infrastructure from floods and wildfires, and to secure the viability of European solidarity mechanisms, such as the EU Solidarity Fund.   Extreme weather  has health impacts, particularly on vulnerable groups. The elderly, children and people in poor health are more likely to be affected by heatwaves, for example. Global mean temperature between 2013 and 2023 was 1.19 to 1.22°C warmer than the pre-industrial level, which makes it the warmest decade on record.  European land temperatures  have increased even faster over the same period by 2.12 to 2.19°C. Between 1980 and 2023, weather- and climate-related extremes caused  economic losses  of EUR 738 billion in the European Union, with over EUR 162 billion (22%) between 2021 and 2023.   Diseases are moving north . Mosquitos and ticks carrying infectious diseases are gaining a foothold in many parts of Europe.       Arctic sea ice has declined  by an average of 74,000 km 2 in summer and 32,000 km 2  in winter since 1979    .   Severe droughts  caused a 3% annual vegetation productivity loss in affected areas from 2000-2019    .
